Throughout the past 20 years, the implicit assessment of psychological constructs has become vastly popular in social sciences. But what does implicit mean? In this seminar, an excursus on the meaning and implications of the term implicit is provided, along with an introduction on the most common implicit measures, such as the Implicit Association Test (IAT) and the Go/No-go Association Task (GNAT). The scientific evidence and theoretical thinking that lead to the shift from the identification
of implicit with the unconscious to its identification with indirect measurement will be given particular attention. A practical application is presented as well, where IAT data are scored with different open source softwares.

# Implicit assessment in psychology: Myths, doubts, and practical applications

The first lecture (available [here](Introduzione/presentazione.pdf)) deals with the theoretical implications for the unconscious of the word implicit. 
The functioning of four common implicit measures is illustrated as well. 
The issues related to one of the most popular implicit measure, the Implicit Association Test (IAT) are discussed. Finally, a new modelling framework for the IAT accuracy and time responses is introduced. 

# Implicit assessment in psychology: How to work with the IAT

The second lecture (available [here](Pratica/evening.pdf)) presents two ways for scoring the IAT with its most common scoring procedure, the *D* score algorithm. Specifically, the use of the online web application [DScoreApp](https://fisppa.psy.unipd.it/DscoreApp/) is illustrated along with the functioning of the [`implicitMeasures`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/implicitMeasures/index.html) package in `R`.
To be an active listener to the second lecture, the data sets used for the examples are available [here](Pratica/Datasets & Code/IATdata.dat). Moreover, a schematic `R` code for scoring the IAT data and performing further analyses is available [here](Pratica/Datasets & Code/IATcode.R).
